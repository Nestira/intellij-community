There are two styles to convert collection to array: either using a pre-sized array
(like <b>c.toArray(new String[c.size()])</b>) or using an empty array (like
<b>c.toArray(new String[0])</b>.
<p>
  In older Java versions using pre-sized array was recommended as a reflection
  call which is necessary to create an array of proper size was quite slow.
  However since late updates of OpenJDK 6 this call was intrinsified making
  the performance of the empty array version the same and sometimes even better, comparing
  to the pre-sized version. Also passing pre-sized array is dangerous for concurrent or
  synchronized collection as data race is possible between the <b>size</b> and <b>toArray</b>
  call which may result in extra nulls at the end of the array if the collection was concurrently
  shrinked during the operation.
</p>
<p>
  This inspection allows to follow the uniform style: either using an empty array
  (which is recommended in modern Java)
  or using a pre-sized array (which might be faster in older Java versions or some non-HotSpot based JVMs).
